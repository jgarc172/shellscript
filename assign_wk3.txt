1. Design the algorithm and write the pseudocode for the steps of this algorithm that does the following:

- A welcome message indicating your name (the user).

basic tools: 
    * environment or shell variables identifying the user:
           $LOGNAME, $USER, $HOME
algorithm:
    * identify the current user using any available variable
    * display a welcome message to the current user
pseudocode:
    * use $LOGNAME
    * set msg = "Welcome $LOGNAME"
    * print msg

- The host computer you are logged in.

basic tools: 
    * environment or shell variables identifying the host computer:
           $HOSTNAME
algorithm:
    * identify the name of the host computer using any available variable
    * display the name of the host computer
pseudocode:
    * use $HOSTNAME
    * set msg = "You are logged in to $HOSTNAME"
    * print msg

- The date and time you last logged in, not including this time. (Try last -2 $LOGNAME (If this is the first time 
  you have logged in to this system, it is acceptable for the output to indicate the last login is the current login session.))

basic tools: 
    * commands:
        last - prints listing of last logged in sessions with columns identifying the users, date, time, etc.
               The listing will include the current session for the current user.  So the result for the
               current user will include one or more lines.  All is needed for the last is the last 2 
               sessions.  The output includes a footer
        grep - prints lines matching a pattern
        cut  - removes specified sections (columns/fields) from each line of input
        sed  - filters and transforms a line of input

    * variables:
        $LOGNAME - logged in user's name

aalgorithm:
tmp="$(last -2 $LOGNAME | grep $LOGNAME | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f4-7)"
    * obtain the two most recent log in sessions for the current user using the command 'last'
    * to remove the footer of 'last' select lines matching the current user using 'grep'
    * to clean the columns, replace whitespace with a single space using 'tr'
    * select the columns that contain the date and time using 'cut'
    * count the number of lines using 'wc'
    * if there is only one line then select the first line using 'sed'
    * if there are two lines then select the second line using 'sed'
    * display a message that includes the date and time
pseudocode:
    * sessions = last two login sessions for current user
    * sessions = $sessions | select lines that contain $LOGNAME with 'grep'
    * sessions = $sessions | remove whitespace with 'tr'
    * sessions = $sessions | select date time fields with 'cut'
    * count = $sessions | count lines with 'wc'
    * set count = the number of lines in the command (last -2 $LOGNAME)
    * if count == 1
        set line = first line
      else
        set line = second line
    * set login_date = the range of columns 4-7 from line
    * set msg = "You last logged in on login_date"
    * print msg

- Displays how many local (non-environment) and environment variables you have defined. (This requires arithmetic.)
    
- Displays the directories in your search path, in the order they are searched, one-per-line.
2. Takes three valid integers from the user. Make sure they are valid.

3. Finds the largest and smallest number of the three integers.

4. Performs the following on each combination of two from the three numbers and display the results; Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

5. Reports that the script is done and exits.
