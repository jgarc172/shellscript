Write a script that reads up to 25 integer values of weekly rainfall for a given city.
The script should then report how many values were read, then calculate the average rainfall.
The output of the script should display all  rainfall values 
followed by the amount above or below the average for each week. 
Finally, the script displays the smallest and largest rainfall values for the year. 
Please make sure to document all functions of the script and to define results as displayed

synopsis:
    rf [file]
file - input file or stdin with integer values, one line at a time

- Algorithm

1. read the contents of input file that contains multiple integer values, one for each line.
2. convert the contents to an array of integer values
3. calculate the following from the set of integers:
    a. average
    b. smallest
    c. largest
4. display the following output:
    a. each integer value followed by its difference from the average value
    b. the smallest value
    c. the largest value

- Pseudocode

1. read the input file $1 with a filter such as "cat"
2. for each line read, append it to an array "rainfall"
3. call the following functions to obtain the respective values:
    a. avg = average($rainfall)
    b. sm = min($rainfall)
    c. lg = max($rainfall)
4. display the following values:
    a. for value in $rainfall
          print $value ($avg - $value)
    
    b. print "smallest: $sm"
    c. print "largest: $lg"

average function:
    sum = 0
    for value in $1
        sum = sum + $value
    return $sum

min function:
    length = size of $1
    min = $1[0]
